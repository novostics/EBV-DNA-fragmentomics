# EBV DNA fragmentomics

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is strongly associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in endemic regions. Plasma EBV DNA analysis has demonstrated great potential for NPC screening and surveillance. The specific molecular features of EBV DNA fragments from NPC patients can enhance NPC detection and risk evaluation.

## Description

Studies have demonstrated the non-random fragmentation patterns of cell-free DNA (cfDNA), which is governed by different pathophysiological processes. Analysis of the fragmentation profile (i.e., fragmentomics) has shown potential for the diagnostics of a wide spectrum of diseases.

We evaluated the clinical utility of plasma EBV DNA fragmentomics in NPC screening. Among a prospective cohort of about 20,000 subjects that had undergone two rounds of screening, we analyzed the first-round blood samples of EBV DNA PCR-positive subjects (n=558). Those who would subsequently have NPC in the second round displayed a distinctive mononucleosomal size pattern, an NPC-associated end motif profile (e.g., depleted CC-motif), and aberrations in methylation deduced by fragmentomics-based methylation analysis (FRAGMA). Subjects with higher EBV quantity and all these aberrant fragmentomics features had a relative risk of 87.1 times for having NPC in the second round, compared to subjects negative for EBV DNA on PCR.

These results demonstrated plasma DNA fragmentomics could predict future cancer risk.
